## AVOID THE  ALIENS AND SCORE GOALS - THE GAME

Disclaimer:

This was my first ever coding project. The code itself is kind of ridiculous, looking back with hindsight. The amount of nested ifs is somewhat insane, and if I were to do it again I would do it *very* differently. 

However the whole point is to keep this pure and exactly how I built it, and it makes me really happy.

Initially built for Python 2.7 with vpython, but had to do some upgrades to make it run on python3 as some stuff changed with vpython apparently and it now runs with GlowScript:

https://www.glowscript.org/

To Play:

- clone the repo
- pip install vpython (if necessary)
- python3 finalproject.py

Controls:

Up - Move up on the Y plane

Down - Move down on the Y plane

Left - Move left on the X plane

Right - Move right on the X plane

A - Move up on the Z plane	

Z - Move down on the Z plane

Instructions:

You are a ball! Amazing! Control the ball and knock the other balls into the goal on the left, then go into the goal yourself to win! But, watch out! The aliens will try to stop you! They donâ€™t care about the other balls, only you! If you get knocked back into your own goal, you lose! 

For an easy win, don't use the z axis.
